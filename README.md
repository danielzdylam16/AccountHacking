# AccountHacking

I hacked a teacher’s account for fun by coding a Python program. I did it with multiple threads and other stuff. 
(When i firstly tried it, it always went south saying a error created in the program and thus stopped. And that error was caused because the server refused to connect, so i added a sleep and while function so that the program can continue correctly.)
I hope u guys can enjoy hacking others’ account if it’s damn easy to crack (number of serval digits).

And ofc, don’t never, ever do anything to harm others if you damage his/her account against   
others’ free wills.
